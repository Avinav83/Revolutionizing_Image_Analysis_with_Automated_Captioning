# Revolutionizing_Image_Analysis_with_Automated_Captioning
The ultimate purpose of Automated caption generator is to make users experience better by generating automated captions.
Generating captions for images is a vital task relevant to the area of both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Mimicking the human ability of providing descriptions for images by a machine is itself a remarkable step along the line of Artificial Intelligence. The main challenge of this task is to capture how objects relate to each other in the image and to express them in a natural language (like English).
